<h1>Sys/Dev Basics</h1>

<p>The first thing students should know about the Sys/Dev curriculum is how it is designed to provide them with the foundational skills they will need to become one of the many types of network engineer. This field of study is quite broad, and requires knowledge not only of how to program software, but of how to expertly operate an OS (especially GNU/Linux), how networking works (a massive field in and of itself), have an understanding of hardware and its limitations, and how to design and automate a system to meet the specific needs of the software that their employer is distributing via the Internet. In other words, they should not expect the curriculum to be easy.</p>
<p>The two topics mentioned above that are absolutely foundational to learning to become a DevOps engineer<a href="https://students-support.hbtn.io/hc/en-us/articles/360023882914-SysAdmin-DevOps-Foundations#h_3f8396da-e6c4-4922-baf0-0e7312fe50fe" target="_self"></a> are operating systems and networking. These are the two topics that will be covered most extensively in the Foundations curriculum. If a student can become an expert at these two things, the rest will follow much more easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catch is, they cannot code/whiteboard their way into understanding operating systems and networking without first putting in a lot of legwork. This means reading, a lot. Before they start a project or code anything, they absolutely need to do their due diligence when it comes to the reading. Not only the reading that is provided on the project page, but most often beyond. In the world of network engineering (and CS in general), readings can become outdated quite rapidly, or be missing important pieces of information, or have only partially true information. This is most often not the author&rsquo;s fault, but simply a byproduct of differences that exist between their and students&rsquo; systems/software versions. This can mean a lot of trial and error on top of out of the box thinking.</p>
<p>All this being said, once students start to get comfortable with network/systems engineering, not only will they start to have fun, it will make them better at&nbsp;<em>any</em> job in the tech industry.</p>
